-> ResponseEntity represents an HTTP response, including headers, body, and status. While @ResponseBody puts the return value into the body of the response, 
ResponseEntity also allows us to add headers and status code.

ResponseEntity is meant to represent the entire HTTP response,HTTP status code and HTTP header. 
We can control anything that goes into it such as HTTP status code, headers, and body. 

@ResponseBody only returns the HTTP ResponseBody.
@ResponseEntity can control HTTP status code. HTTP headers.

ResponseEntity is a class in Spring Framework that represents an HTTP response. It is commonly used in Spring Boot applications to customize the 
HTTP response returned by a controller method. 
The main purpose of using ResponseEntity is to provide more control over the response status code, headers, and the response body.
